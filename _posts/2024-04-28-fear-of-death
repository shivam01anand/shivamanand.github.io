## Foundations Series

I started running again last year, but feared i'd get a heart attack because i'm vaxxxed (just media entering fears in me).

This was also the time I started having pretty intense nightmares about an incoming Death.

In it, I see everything shut down one by one and finally the visual of a 2000s TV turning off aka me. And i'd get jolted awake.

Then, i ran a HM and the last few KMs i persevered by wanting to get rid of that nightmare.

And it worked - no more nightmares for months.

Now, i've been doing HIIT, and it makes my heart extremely alive and on the edge.. Every session, I accept it might be my last. I find that's the correct way to live, isn't it?
