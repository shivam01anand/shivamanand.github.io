## Why am I tracking them all?

These are obviously people who've devoted their lives to this field, and I'm eager to explore every "Type" of excavation they've unearthed related to the self - including emotions, memories, attitudes, reactions, etc.

## Why am I writing them all?

To build a toolkit. I've found box breathing to be immediately useful in meetings, exercise holds, etc. Why not build a Swiss Army knife filled with those tools?

## What are the sources?

- **Alo Moves**: A platform that deserves its own space for its unique offerings.
- **[Balance](https://shivam.world/2024/03/16/balance-meditations.html)**: Another significant avenue, meriting separate consideration.
- **[Waking Up](https://shivam.world/2024/03/16/waking-up-meditations.html)**: A unique space for mindfulness and meditation.

Additionally, I'd consider adding **YouTube** to this list if I find a structured way to categorize its content types.
