Going with a simple Positive/Negative framework doesn't do justice to pursuits like these. Even a project report talking about goals achieved, timings, doesn't hit the spot.

Sure, my training was incomplete. 
Sure, i missed my a,b,c,d targets.
Sure, i was way behind the pack.
Sure, my broken body was rightfully sarcastically applauded "nice training!" (by the organizing team no less LOL)

Sure, everything hurts right now, half a day later.
    -Calves pulsated like it had it's own heartbeat during the run.
    -My butts were hurting. Butts. The loyal support you rely on for half a day everyday gave up.
    -Heels were on fire. I know how pam felt.
    -Knees hurt so much my road accident from years back felt like a joke. Those wounds pained so much, even touching it generated visuals.
    -My back hurts. Don't know how, and how shoulders feel file.

But there was a story here. One deserving a firm note in life's diary.

 The day before my run, I had stuffed chicken breast with spanish/cheese, egyptian pizza, dimsums, peshwari tikka, pasta. Pleasing the senses, before killing it soflty. Day of the run.

I couldn't have imagined a better setting. The race's kick off soothed by a pleasing drizzle in the sunrise, with loud sounds of drums charing people up.
A bollywood story has one protaginist, here there were 1000s. Each stretching in their own ways, my non existent routine was marvelling at them. Might as well observe the pros if this is going to be an imperfect run.

Coach benett, tucked in headphones, begins with a warning of the automatic human desire to pick up pace when passed by another human. Sure enough i accelerate intermittently. It's clearly not a solo effort, in isolation.
I start understanding my friends' strava posts where they do race distances in their backyards - free of lines, anxiety of approaching cars, the boy who stops to inquire about the 2k finish line, the pomp.

The pomp is doing nothing for me - it should, based on probability. I've seen countless posts about race stoke, how others energies shot them to unbelievable timings.

Then I'm hit with unempathetic nourishment from happy runners, when they smile into my eyes. They just aren't in pain & it's hard to mask runner's high's endorphins.

I raech 5k. faster than my training pace. I can't help notice oddities around me - a marathi running barefoot with a flag, an overweight aunt running 21k (who rests against my human pole when later on she was about to pass out). Building focus is a challenge, i get to 10k but the pain's shooting up. It's clear my targets are in danger.

I attempt that thing where you dedicate each km to someone you love. parents, family, loves, dead friend, all of the slideshows are crisp & fast in my clear state of mind.

I understand now why i couldn't drift into more distracting thoughts. I never managed to hit a flow state.
Should i take the cycle path for this stretch? Where are the cars coming from at intersection? Where are the stalls? Should i run straight here or turn left?

The terrain, race track should be known and visualized before hand. Or even better, practise in random places so you retain joy of randomness but aren't facing new flavours of questions race day.
My practise was running alone at 12 am in a private park. I was almost always in trance in those silent nights.

I card loaded last 3-4 days, i'm eating banana glucon-d nuts at the periodic stalls in the race. I'm not sure which is helping which, whether i'll have accurate data for analysis to inform next time.

It doesn't matter, This 10k-15k is all about managing to give myself a chance to sprint the finale, and get to a respectable (how do you define respect for "races" you didn't set out to win? how important then are those personal targets?)

As i saw myself losing my race for target A...B...C my pace dropped even more. Talk about self serving impact of attitudes.

"Everything hurts" was overpowering. I tried to run & my calves started beating hard, locking the leg into stallness.
Songs, they helped. They just weren't loud enough.

My sweating literally made my watch press the finish button. When everything is drenched, how exactly do you wipe off sweat from phone, when you want to reconnect to your headphones? lack of flow state and how lamely so.

My goal of running, forget the HM, was to master breathing, power & space in head.

I'm glad i'm running this HM. I welcome all oppotunities at masochism. 

Is my "first" HM tainted from poor results? I do not care about the numbers - how a run went, or which run it was. As long as it was a run i got to experience.

I hear tags like being a sub-3 marathoner, a 2:20 mrathoner in communities. I'm sure some of them were here, their wry smiles accompaning their proud strides.

I'm not going for that for the same reason i said no to well defined career ladders of MBA, quant MS, Dev/EM - where's the randomness in that?

Part of why i love coach benett's programme, is because he does not care about the numbers on the watch. 

I loved the part where i hid my watch from me, so i could run freely. It was an attempt to realign my style with my goal.

Being free.
