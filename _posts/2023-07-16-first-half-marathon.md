Describing pursuits in a positive/negative framework doesn't say much, neither does a project report talking about goals, timings & other abstract things.

The day before my run, I had chicken breast with spanish/cheese stuffings, egyptian pizza, dimsums, peshwari tikka, pasta. Pleased the senses, before punishing it's vehicle.

Day of the run.
I couldn't have constructed a better setting. The race's kick off was beautifully set up by a pleasing drizzle in the sunrise, with loud drums charging up the runners.
A bollywood story has one protagonist, here there were 1000s. Each stretching their selves in unique ways, my non existent routine was marvelling at them. Figured might as well observe the pros if this is going to be my beginner attempt.

Coach benett's marathon playlist from NRC, tucked in headphones, began with a warning. 

Of the automatic human desire to pick up pace when passed by another human. Sure enough i noticed myself accelerate whenever a body entered my private space, of which there wasn't much. This is clearly not a solo run in isolation. This is going to be a group thing.

Anyone who sees grown ups waking up at 4 am on a Sunday to run won't hesistate to call these crazies a tribe. 

I start understanding my friends posts where they ran long distances in their backyards - free of competition, anxiety of approaching cars, the boy who stops to inquire about the 2k finish line almost teasing your 21k resolve, the...pomp

The pomp is surprisingly not helping me yet. I'd seen countless posts about race stoke, how others energies shot them to unbelievable timings, the atmosphere the postivity..god damn it. 

As i stroll forward, in pain, the glue of my resolve softened in the rain - I'm hit with unempathetic beaming smiles from happy runners. Fuck you. 
Alas, It's not their fault - they just aren't in enough pain, and their unmasked endorphins only intensifies the gulf in feelings. Making those interactions highly charged.

I reach 5k. faster than my training pace. I can't help marvel at the oddities around me - a south indian running barefoot with a banner written in marathi (a language no one understands here), an overweight aunt also running 21k (who rests against me later on when she was about to pass out). 

Building focus is a challenge, i get to 10k but the pain's shooting up. It's clear my targets are in danger.

I attempt that thing where you dedicate each km to someone you love. parents, family, loves, dead friends -- however all the slideshows are crisp & quickly disappear from my clear mind.

I understand now why i couldn't drift into more distracting thoughts. I never managed to hit a flow state.
Should i take the cycle path for this stretch? Where are the cars coming from at intersection? Where are the stalls? Should i run straight here or turn left? Do i want the banana or the nuts from the stall? 
Too many conscious decisions!

The terrain, race track should be known and visualized before hand. Or even better, practise in random places so you retain joy of randomness but aren't facing new flavours of questions race day.
My practise was running alone at 12 am in a private park. I was almost always in trance in those silent nights.

I card loaded last 3-4 days, i'm eating banana glucon-d nuts at the periodic stalls in the race. I'm not sure which is helping which, whether i'll have accurate data for analysis to inform next time.

It doesn't matter, This 10k-15k is all about managing to give myself a chance to sprint the finale, and get to a respectable (how do you define respect for "races" you didn't set out to win? how important then are those personal targets?)

As i saw myself losing my race for target A...B...C my pace dropped even more. Talk about self serving impact of attitudes.

"Everything hurts" were the continuous whispers from my bones. The carb loading - banana on the day or the pasta yesterday meant i had energy, so tried to run through the pain. 100 meters in, my calves started beating HARD. locking the leg into stilness.
Songs, they helped. They just weren't loud enough.

Meanwhile the sweating made my watch somehow press the finish button. When everything is drenched, how exactly do you wipe off sweat from phone, when you want to reconnect to your headphones? this was not part of the script (there was no script but who's script would have this problem?)

My goal of running, forget the HM, was to master breathing, power & space in head.

I realize I'm glad i'm running this HM. I welcome all opportunities at masochism. It's an exercise in overcoming defeated thoughts. I gave myself a bank of 20 points, consuming which i'd allow myself a rest. I deducted points each time i overcame a negative thought of wanting to rest prematurely. How creative our minds are rational those thoughts are from the human mind. 

Is my "first" HM tainted from poor results? I do not care about the numbers - how a run went, or which run it was. As long as it was a run i got to experience.

I hear tags like being a sub-3 marathoner, a 2:20 mrathoner in communities. I'm sure some of them were here, their wry smiles accompaning their proud strides.

I'm not going for that for the same reason i said no to well defined career ladders of MBA, quant MS, Dev/EM - where's the randomness in that?

Part of why i love coach benett's programme, is because he does not care about the numbers on the watch. 

I loved the part where i hid my watch from me, so i could run freely. It was an attempt to realign my style with my goal.

Being free.

Sure, my training was incomplete. 
Sure, i missed my a,b,c,d targets.
Sure, i was way behind the pack.
Sure, my broken body was rightfully sarcastically applauded "nice training!" (by the organizing team no less LOL)
Sure, everything hurts right now, half a day later.
    - Calves pulsated like it had it's own heartbeat. 
    - My butts were hurting. Butts! The loyal support you rely on for 12 hours a day gave up.
    - Heels were on fire. I know how pam felt. 
    - Knees hurt so much that my road accident from years ago felt like a joke. And those wounds used to hurt so much, even touching it generated visuals.
    - My back hurts. Don't know how, and how shoulders feel file.

"Objectively" speaking, it was terrible but there's a story here. One deserving a firm note in life's diary.
