When the pursuit is just a hobby, and you're not going for olympics should you really do a project report talking about goals, timings?

Day of the run's finally here after months of midnight runs.

For my last supper, I had chicken breast with spanish/cheese stuffings, egyptian pizza, dimsums, peshwari tikka, pasta. Enjoyment then pain, this cycle of life.

I couldn't have thought of a better setting for the race. 
At 4 am (okay not quite ideal), we took our positions amidst a welcoming drizzle from the sunrise, with loud drums charging everyone, punjabi style.

While a bollywood story has one protagonist, here there were 1000s. Some running 21k, some 2k. 70s, single digits. Army folks, obese netflix enthusiasts.  

Each stretching their bodies in unique ways, my non existent routine was marvelling at them. Figured might as well observe the pros if this is going to be my beginner attempt.

Coach benett's marathon playlist from NRC, tucked in headphones, kicks off the "race" with a warning. 
The automatic human desire to pick up pace when passed by another human, and how one needs to ignore by trusting in training. Sure enough i noticed myself accelerate whenever a body entered my private space, of which there wasn't much. 

This is clearly not a solo run in isolation. This is going to be a group thing.
The group of crazies, running at 4 am on a Sunday. Weaving between cars, on an iconic but very public road.

I start appreciating my friends posts where they ran long distances in their backyards - free of competition, anxiety of approaching cars, the boy who stops to inquire about the 2k finish line almost teasing your 21k resolve, the...pomp

The pomp is surprisingly not helping me at all. 
I'd seen countless posts about race stoke, how others energies shot them to unbelievable timings, the atmosphere, the radiant postivity floating in the air..I start cursing those missing elements as my legs start hurting in new places.

As i stroll forward, in pain, the glue of my resolve softened in the rain - I'm hit with unempathetic beaming smiles from happy runners. Fuck you. 
Alas, it's not their fault - they just aren't in enough pain, and their unmasked endorphins only intensifies the gulf in feelings. Making those interactions highly charged.

5k is crossed, a races finishes here, the dispersion of people near me is more than welcome.
Yet i can't help but marvel at oddities in even distant views - a south indian running barefoot with a banner written in marathi (a language no one understands here), an overweight aunt also running 21k (who rests against me later on when she was about to pass out). 
Building focus is a challenge in this fascinating opposite-of-cruise ship, i get to 10k but the pain's shooting up. It's clear my targets are in danger.

I attempt that thing where you dedicate each km to someone you love. parents, family, loves, dead friends -- however all the slideshows are crisp & quickly disappear from my clear mind.

I understand now why i couldn't drift into more distracting thoughts. I never managed to hit a flow state.
Should i take the cycle path for this stretch? Where are the cars coming from at intersection? Where are the stalls? Should i run straight here or turn left? Do i want the banana or the nuts from the stall? 
Too many conscious decisions!

The terrain, race track should be known and visualized before hand. Or even better, practise in random places so you retain joy of randomness but aren't facing new flavours of questions race day.
My practise was running alone at 12 am in a private park. I was almost always in trance in those silent nights.

I card loaded last 3-4 days, i'm eating banana glucon-d nuts at the periodic stalls in the race. I'm not sure which is helping which, whether i'll have accurate data for analysis to inform next time.

It doesn't matter, This 10k-15k is all about managing to give myself a chance to sprint the finale, and get to a respectable (how do you define respect for "races" you didn't set out to win? how important then are those personal targets?)

As i saw myself losing my race for target A...B...C my pace dropped even more. Talk about self serving impact of attitudes.

"Everything hurts" were the continuous whispers from my bones. The carb loading - banana on the day or the pasta yesterday meant i had energy, so tried to run through the pain. 100 meters in, my calves started beating HARD. locking the leg into stilness.
Songs, they helped. They just weren't loud enough.

Meanwhile the sweating made my watch somehow press the finish button. When everything is drenched, how exactly do you wipe off sweat from phone, when you want to reconnect to your headphones? this was not part of the script (there was no script but who's script would have this problem?)

My goal of running, forget the HM, was to master breathing, power & space in head.

I realize I'm glad i'm running this HM. I welcome all opportunities at masochism. It's an exercise in overcoming defeated thoughts. I gave myself a bank of 20 points, consuming which i'd allow myself a rest. I deducted points each time i overcame a negative thought of wanting to rest prematurely. How creative our minds are rational those thoughts are from the human mind. 

Is my "first" HM tainted from poor results? I do not care about the numbers - how a run went, or which run it was. As long as it was a run i got to experience.

I hear tags like being a sub-3 marathoner, a 2:20 mrathoner in communities. I'm sure some of them were here, their wry smiles accompaning their proud strides.

I'm not going for that for the same reason i said no to well defined career ladders of MBA, quant MS, Dev/EM - where's the randomness in that?

Part of why i love coach benett's programme, is because he does not care about the numbers on the watch. 

I loved the part where i hid my watch from me, so i could run freely. It was an attempt to realign my style with my goal.

Being free.

Sure, my training was incomplete. 
Sure, i missed my a,b,c,d targets.
Sure, i was way behind the pack.
Sure, my broken body was rightfully sarcastically applauded "nice training!" (by the organizing team no less LOL)
Sure, everything hurts right now, half a day later.
    - Calves pulsated like it had it's own heartbeat. 
    - My butts were hurting. Butts! The loyal support you rely on for 12 hours a day gave up.
    - Heels were on fire. I know how pam felt. 
    - Knees hurt so much that my road accident from years ago felt like a joke. And those wounds used to hurt so much, even touching it generated visuals.
    - My back hurts. Don't know how, and how shoulders feel file.

"Objectively" speaking, it was terrible but there's a story here. One deserving a firm note in life's diary.
