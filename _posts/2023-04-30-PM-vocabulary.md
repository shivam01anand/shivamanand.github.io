Jargon can be alienating, forceful & sometimes misaligned with the goal they wanted to achieve.

I've had a problem with it since my first gig, at EY.

While i was OK with lingo like Touching Base, Bandwidth as part of it's corporate oh so professional culture,
finding these during quiet time of reading the subject (quant) was extremely annoying

"stochastic" -- why not just call it random!?

These weren't some elaborate gatekeeping big brain move, it just wasn't cared for.

Having moved into the product world, jargons quite pleasantly can't be found that easily, but they still do exist..albeit micro versions of it.

This is my personal list of those

1)
Users we want to target.....with our sniper!?

Well, i for one don't want to be "targetted"

Instead..
How about...
People we want to help?

By rewriting words in this way, we can promote a more positive, human-centered approach that is not only easier to understand but also subtly influences how we shape experiences for them.
